## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions. Recent:
- Scope = FE-used endpoints only (`.planning/reference/fe-endpoint-inventory.md` is the contract).
- No server-side OpenAPI codegen (oapi-codegen lacks 3.1 support) — hand-written handlers + Go contract tests.
- Full-stack Playwright E2E (real BE + ephemeral Postgres); exhaustive per Gherkin AC.
- One phase per epic, dependency-ordered, auth first.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 depends on Docker being available for the ephemeral Postgres in the E2E harness.
